## What is this?
This a little love project of something i pitched to my future wife while we're working at a records department in medical.

# Why the name?
the name is a pun on Post-Its, because we use them a lot in our office. often leaving them in records that need to be shrunk or amended.

# when will it be updated?
i will on and off be working on this.

# Any othe thoughts?
if you know anyone who is hiring help a man out.
its been way too long finding a job in the SF Bay Area,
Me and the lady are moving over there together.
just need stable income.
