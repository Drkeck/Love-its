This a little love project of something i pitched to my future wife while we're working at a records department in medical.

the name is a pun on Post-Its, because we use them a lot in our office. often leaving them in records that need to be shrunk or amended.

i will on and off be working on this.

oh and if you know anyone who is hiring help a man out.
